Absolutely! Here's a comprehensive `README.md` draft for your project, including workflow, endpoints, and important notes:

## Project Overview
This system allows:
- CRUD operations for employees
- Tracking check-in/check-out times
- Calculating working hours
- Filtering attendance by date, employee, or manager

It uses:
- **PostgreSQL** for persistence
- **Dropwizard** as the REST API framework
- **JDBI** for database interaction

---

## Database Schema

### Employees Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    reporting_to VARCHAR(50)
);

### Attendance Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE attendance (
    attendance_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES employees(emp_id),
    check_in TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    check_out TIMESTAMP
);
```

## API Endpoints

### Employee Endpoints

| Method | Path              | Description           |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| POST   | `/employees`      | Create a new employee |
| GET    | `/employees`      | List all employees    |
| GET    | `/employees/{id}` | Get employee by ID    |
| DELETE | `/employees/{id}` | Delete employee by ID |

### Attendance Endpoints

| Method | Path                                      | Description                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/employees/{id}/attendance`              | Add check-in/check-out for employee                 |
| GET    | `/employees/{id}/attendance`              | Get attendance records for an employee              |
| GET    | `/employees/attendance/date/{date}`       | Get all attendance records for a date               |
| GET    | `/employees/attendance/manager/{manager}` | Get attendance for employees reporting to a manager |
| GET    | `/employees/{id}/attendance/hours`        | Get working hours for an employee                   |

## Workflow

1. **Create Employee**:

   * `POST /employees` → returns `empId`

2. **Check-in / Check-out**:

   * `POST /employees/{id}/attendance` → assigns `check_in` / `check_out`

3. **View Attendance**:

   * By employee → `/employees/{id}/attendance`
   * By date → `/employees/attendance/date/{YYYY-MM-DD}`
   * By manager → `/employees/attendance/manager/{managerName}`

4. **Calculate Working Hours**:

   * `/employees/{id}/attendance/hours` → shows total hours worked

---

## Validation & Business Logic

* `empId` is auto-generated for each employee
* Attendance must have `check_in` before `check_out`
* Duplicate employees can be identified by **email** (if used)
* Business logic (validation, working hours) is centralized in **EmployeeService**

---

## Docker / Podman Setup

`docker-compose.yml` example:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres_db:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: dev_postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: dev_database
      POSTGRES_USER: dev_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: dev_pass
    volumes:
      - dev_pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5433:5432"

  admin_panel:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    container_name: dev_pgadmin
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@dev.ai
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: adminpass
    ports:
      - "8081:80"
    depends_on:
      - postgres_db

volumes:
  dev_pgdata: {}
```

* Access PostgreSQL:

```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U dev_user -d dev_database
```

* Access pgAdmin: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

---

## Important Notes

* **CRLF vs LF**: Windows uses CRLF (`\r\n`), Linux/macOS uses LF (`\n`). Git warns about this when committing files.
* Use **BeanMapper / bindBean** for JDBI mapping.
* Avoid duplicate `empId`; optionally identify employees by **email**.
* **Validation** should happen in the service layer.
* Avoid ambiguous JAX-RS endpoints — each GET/POST path must be unique.

---

## Sample Attendance JSON

```json
{
    "checkIn": "2025-08-19T09:00:00",
    "checkOut": "2025-08-19T18:00:00"
}
```

---

This workflow captures **employee creation**, **attendance logging**, **retrieval**, and **working hour calculation** in a clean service-oriented architecture.

```

I can also make a **diagram showing the workflow** of Employee → Attendance → Working Hours → Reports if you want, which you can embed in the README.  

Do you want me to create that diagram too?
```
